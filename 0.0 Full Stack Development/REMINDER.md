### 🎗️ Self Reminder
10 years from now you will surely become someone, the big question is who?
- What would you like to have?
- Where do you want to go?
- How much would you like to earn?

These are some major question to ask.

If you go to work on it now.

Sure enough in a very short period of time you can take on a new direction to be the kind of person you want to be.
